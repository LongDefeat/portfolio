          Hello! My name is Mason Sams and I&aposm a software engineer from
          sunny Pasadena, CA. My roots in the legal profession as a paralegal
          have provided me with a unique lens through which I approach software
          engineering.

          Over the last few years I&aposve been a teacher and a paralegal, but
          over the pandemic I decided to shift my focus towards software
          engineering. After months of watching youtube videos and Udemy
          courses, I enrolled and completed the Springboard full-stack
          engineering bootcamp which led me to find my niche in JavaScript, and
          frameworks like React. I&aposve dedicated myself to continuous
          learning, demonstrated by my 800-hour course completion at
          Springboard. Here, I honed my skills in both frontend and backend
          development and I continue to study intricate data structures and
          algorithms in my free time.

          But I&aposm not all about my coding journey. In late 2022, I
          established the &quotLearn, Teach, Code&quot meetup group in Pasadena,
          championing a space for engineers around Los Angeles to collaborate
          and learn from one another. Super thankful I started the meetup as I
          now have many friends I hang out with outside the meetup, but also
          it&aposs allowed me the opportunity to guide budding engineers in
          their coding journeys.

          Away from tech, my academic background in History and German Language
          from the University of Arkansas complements my global perspective.
          It&aposs not just about solving problems, but understanding broader
          narratives.

          When I find spare time, you can find me learning new instruments,
          composing music for short films, and finally perfecting Steely Dan
          songs on guitar.
